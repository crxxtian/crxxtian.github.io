# Cyber Olive Theme

A sleek, open-source portfolio theme with a cyberpunk-inspired forest-green aesthetic, perfect for cybersecurity professionals and tech enthusiasts. I built this theme to showcase my journey as a cybersecurity student, blending a cool design with a focus on my passion for tech and finance.

**Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Google Fonts (JetBrains Mono, Poppins, Rajdhani), and Jekyll for static site generation.

**To Customize:**

    1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/crxxtian/your-repo-name.git
    2. Install Jekyll: Run bundle install (see Jekyll docs for setup).
    3. Edit index.html to update your name, roles, and intro. Also edit portfolio.html and blog.html to your liking.
    4. Modify and add files to _posts for blog posts (format: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md).
    5. Change styles in style.css using CSS variables (e.g., --accent-neon for colors).
    6. Run locally: bundle exec jekyll serve, then open http://localhost:4000.
    7. Deploy: Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
