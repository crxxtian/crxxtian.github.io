# My first blog post.

After around 100 commits, I finally have a website foundation that I am proud of.
I am calling it the "Cyber Olive Theme" and have open-sourced the code in case anyone else wants to use the theme for their site.
I set it up on GitHub pages with free hosting and use the Jekyll blog framework. (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

# Why did I make this website?
After browsing LinkedIn for a while I started to notice most security professionals keep a portfolio/blog site.
I wanted to hop on this trend while also trying to build a site from scratch with what I've learned in my web development class and a little use of AI (ChatGPT, Grok, Claude).

So, if you are reading this, please explore the rest of the website and check back often as there will be new features and blog posts as soon as I graduate and have more free time.

# Thanks for reading.
