      WELCOME TO THE CYBER LAIR

      I'm Cristian, a cybersecurity researcher and privacy advocate with over a decade of experience in the digital trenches. By day, I work as a security consultant helping organizations fortify their defenses. By night, I explore the darker corners of the internet, hunting for vulnerabilities and emerging threats.
      
      This blog is my personal knowledge base and a way to share what I've learned with the community. I believe in digital sovereignty, privacy as a fundamental right, and the importance of open source solutions.
      
      All content here is crafted with care and a commitment to practical, actionable security advice. No tracking, no cookies, no compromise.

## About This Site

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/crxxtian/crxxtian.github.io). No analytics, no trackers, no cookies. Just HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for the menu toggle and progress bar.

I believe the web should be lightweight, accessible, and respectful of your privacy. This site aims to embody these principles.
